## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability, in order to keep it confidential, please do not report an issue on GitHub.

Please email me the details of the vulnerability at salinder.sid@gmail.com; including a description and proof-of-concept that is [short and self-contained.](http://www.sscce.org/)

You should expect a response within a week of your email. Depending on the severity of the issue, this may require some time to draft an immediate bugfix release. Less severe issues may be held until the next release.

We do not award bounties for security vulnerabilities.
